## Overview
This is my personal website and my little corner of the internet. Over the years, it has really functioned as my personal learning grounds. It gave me a space to try out new stuff like coding and writing.

The goals for this revision were to *greatly* simplify it. My previous version became too bloated from all of my experimenting so I cut all of it out and got it down to the pure essentials.

I am using [new.css](https://newcss.net/) as a classless CSS framework and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site.
