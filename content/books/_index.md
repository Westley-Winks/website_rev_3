An incomplete list of books that I have read. I am currently developing a system for taking book notes so ideally, this page would match my new system. This would look similar to [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries) page with a small summary in the drop down then a dedicated page for proper notes and quotes.

A search bar would also be cool.
