An ongoing list of books that I have read. I have a new system for taking book notes and this page will reflect that as time goes on. For the books I have notes on, the summary will be posted here. All of them will have a short blurb about what I think in the dropdown. This is heavily inspired by [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/book-summaries) book summary page.

A search bar would also be cool.
