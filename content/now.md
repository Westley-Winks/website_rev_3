This page serves to give you an idea of what I am currently working on, in no particular order. This is inspired by the "Now page" movement created by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about). In [The Anatomy of Equanimity](https://anatomy.1651.org/) system, these are my current projects and quests.

## Promoting World Peace and Friendship

I am in my second year of service in Morocco as a Peace Corps volunteer. It has been such a wonderful and difficult experience that I wouldn't change for anything. I am here, in part, to increase cross-cultural understanding. I participate in meaningful holidays, have meals with my Moroccan friends and family, and speak the same language they speak (as best as I can).

## Blogging about Morocco and My Peace Corps Service

I started up [this blog]({{< relref "peace-corps" >}}) before I left, wrote a few posts, then neglected to write anything for five months. I just started it back up and have some ideas for future posts. My latest post was about a festival called a [moussem]({{< relref "The Moussem" >}}) and if you'd like to sign up to get the next posts in your email inbox, input your email [here](https://buttondown.email/Westley_Winks).

This goes along with the above quest. They are fun to write but I feel quite a lot of Resistance because I want to tell these stories right and the perfectionism gets in the way.

## Becoming a More Compassionate Person

This one is a bit more abstract and difficult than the rest. This started as a quest towards emotional intelligence until I delved in learned that that is a sub-skill for something much more profound: cultivating meaningful connection between people. One of the most powerful tools for cultivating connection and being in service of others is **compassion** and so that is my quest.

In order, I read [*Nonviolent Communication*]({{< relref "Nonviolent Communication" >}}), [*Permission to Feel*]({{< relref "Permission to Feel" >}}), [*Atlas of the Heart*]({{< relref "Atlas of the Heart" >}}) and [*Self-Compassion*]({{< relref "Self-Compassion" >}}) by Kristin Neff. These have given me a lot of insight and tools from multiple different angles to help me in this quest.

## Writing Book Notes

I have been having a blast with this. I've had quite a bit of free time this summer and have been reading a lot. I wanted some way to engage more with what I am reading and not forget the things that I learn. I read almost exclusively on my Kindle and highlight and note things as I read. At the end, I use my custom Python script to extract all those notes and put them into a markdown file. Then I go through the highlights and write more structured notes in Obsidian and [post them to my website]({{< relref "books" >}}). For non-fiction, I try my best to put things in my own words and bold the really important bits to make the note scannable with the eyes.

For fiction, I do more of a book review structure and am loving it. I hadn't written anything for a fiction book since high school and absolutely hated it then. I use a rating system called [CAWPILE](https://kristinkravesbooks.com/2020/09/14/cawpile-rating-system/) that gives me a nice structure that I need to think more deeply about the fiction I am reading.
