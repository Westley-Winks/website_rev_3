I am a Peace Corps Volunteer serving in the Youth in Development sector in Morocco. I teach English and life skills to youth, share American culture, and learn and share Moroccan culture.

This page serves as a place for me to write stories that represent Moroccan culture so that my American friends have a better understanding of a culture different from their own.
