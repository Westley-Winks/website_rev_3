        <summary>Who are you?</summary>
        <p>My name is Westley Winks. I am currently a Peace Corps Volunteer doing youth development in Morocco. I spend my days building skills with youth, exchanging culture, and learning language.</p>

        <summary>Where am I?</summary>
        <p>This is my personal website and my little corner of the internet. Over the years, it has really functioned as my personal learning grounds. It gave me a space to try out new stuff like coding and writing.</p>

        <p>This website is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Westley-Winks/website">open source</a> and built by me. It has been through many revisions and has taken inspiration from many others. Currently, I am using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as the static site generator, <a href="https://newcss.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new.css</a> as my styling framework, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a> to host it.</p>

        <p>My goal with this revision was to simplify it. It became bloated with all of my experimenting. Hence the use of a completely classless CSS framework. As always and with everything, it's a work in progress.</p>

        <summary>Do you do any writing?</summary>
        <p>I am by no means a professional but I dabble. I just kind of write what and when I feel like it. My most recent posts:</p>
        <ul>
            {{ range first 5 (where site.RegularPages "Type" "in" site.Params.mainSections) }}
            <li>
                <a href="{{ .Permalink }}">{{ .Title }}</a>
                in {{ .Section | humanize | lower }}
            </li>
            {{ end }}
        </ul>
